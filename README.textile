h2. Conjure

Conjure is a Rails like framework for the Clojure programming language. The goal of Conjure is to simplify the development of database backed web applications. To do this Conjure relies heavily on third party libraries including:

* "ring":http://github.com/mmcgrana/ring/tree
* "clj-record":http://github.com/duelinmarkers/clj-record/tree
* "clj-html":http://github.com/mmcgrana/clj-html/tree
* and more..
